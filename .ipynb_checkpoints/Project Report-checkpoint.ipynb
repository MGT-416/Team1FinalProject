    "For this project, we want to analyze football transfers. The data to build our network is web scraped from [`transfermarkt.com`](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), a football-specialized website. This website records all transfers between clubs all around the world, from major leagues to less-popular ones. The data does not concern only the first-level leagues, but also second and inferior divisions. Due to the great granularity of the data stored in this website, our analysis will only take into account all transfers from the 1st January 2015 to the 31 December 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our network is composed of football clubs. Each node represents a club who participate in at least one transfer between the two years of interest. A transfer between two clubs is encapsulated as an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step in this project will be to analyze the differences between the major three types of transfers: Free transfers, loans, and monetary transfers. Each type of transfers has its own specificities, regarding the type of clubs or the characteristics of players. In a second phase, we will look more deeply in the monetary transfers network and the way money flows in this market.\n",
    "\n",
    "We determine distribution of loans and transfers by age for finding relations between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we divide all loans and transfers into 4 age groups and try to find patterns on two different levels: clubs and leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We determine relation between club's pagerank and existence of other clubs in network. We delete one club from initial network and calculate how pagerank of other clubs change after it."

    "Football is the probably the most popular sport in the world. It also one of the sports with the most money flowing around it. With all the financial stakes involved in football, the transfer market is a key moment in a club's sporting and marketing success. In the football transfer market, each club can hire players. If a player already has a contract with another club, both clubs can find a financial agreement for the player leaving a club, the selling club, to join a new team, the buying club. This is what we call **monetary transfers** in this project. Another possibility for a club, or team, to sign a new player is to sign it for free, when the player has no current contract. This is referred to as **free transfer**. Another type of transfer possible is the **loan**, when a player, with a contract with a club, joins a new team for a pre-defined amount of time, negotiated between the two clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we model the football transfer market as a network. Each node represents a club. All nodes have an attribute: the league the club is part. A transfer between two clubs is encapsulated as an edge. As for the nodes, each edge stores information about its transfer, like player or clubs characteristics. When a player leaves club A and sign a new contract with club B, this is represented as a directed edge, from club A to club B. Note that two players might leave club A and join club B: this is represented with two directed edges, from club A node to club B node. Thus, this project will deal with a **Multi Directed Network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we want to answer with this data is: Does the monetary transfers have the same characteristics as the loans on the free transfers? What is the kind of clubs participating in these type of transfers? What are the differences between clubs doing a lot of monetary transfers and the clubs doing loans? What are the interactions between clubs of the same country? Of the same league division? We will also look at the players and try to create a player's profile for each type of transfers. We will also look exclusively at the monetary transfers and try to understand how the money flows between clubs, which are the *key* clubs in this network, which clubs have the more effect on the amount of money involving transfers?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we will mainly rely on centralities measures, like the degree centrality or the PageRank centrality. Diffusion models will also be a key part of our analysis of monetary transfers."

    "In the **loan transfers** and **free transfers** network, the communities are clearly organized after the countries. Primary, secondary and tertiary divisions all always cluster together. There is also some more hybrid communities, like the ones composed of leagues from Portugal and Brazil or Spain and South America countries. The language plays a crucial role in these types of transfers. As for the Portugal-Brazil or Spanish-speaking countries, France and the Belgium primary divisions are clustered together.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Interesting fact**: In the free transfer, the community containing french clubs also contains clubs from the **Qatar Stars League**. This league has never showed up in the analysis before,\n",
    "\n",
    "The **monetary transfers** communities are also tied to this notion of countries, but in a less strong way. Within this network, there are some communities composed mainly by clubs from one country (Germany, England, France), but also communities composed of clubs from more diverse countries, like *Community 3* with clubs from Portugal, Spain, France, Brazil and China. One conclusion that can be made is that when it comes to loans and free transfers, clubs have a preference to deal with close clubs, regarding the country and language. This \"restriction* is less obvious when money is involved. This observation was expected: the more good a player is, the more money its transfer will cost. Good players have the tendency to join big european clubs, thus leaving their home countries in most of the cases."
